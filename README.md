# geth-mev-plugin

Prototype of a reimplementation of mev-geth as a Geth mining plugin (https://github.com/jwasinger/go-ethereum/tree/collator-v3)

## Usage

`make` builds geth and the plugin.  See https://github.com/jwasinger/mev-geth-demo/tree/plugin for a demo of this plugin used as a (nearly) drop-in replacement for mev-geth.
