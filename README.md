# geth-mev-plugin

Prototype of a reimplementation of mev-geth as a [Geth mining plugin](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23421)

## Usage

`make` builds geth and the plugin.  See https://github.com/jwasinger/mev-geth-demo/tree/plugin for a demo of this plugin used as a (nearly) drop-in replacement for mev-geth.
